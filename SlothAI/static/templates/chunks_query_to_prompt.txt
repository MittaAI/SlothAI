{# Use this template to drive an OpenAI dall-e prompt generator. #}

{# Define the input_fields #}
input_fields = [{'name': "chunks", 'type': "strings"},{'name': "query", 'type': "string"}]

{# The output_fields expected from the node processor using this template: #}
output_fields = [{'name': "prompts", 'type': "strings"}]

{# Extras - we set the iterate_key to 'query' to allow all chunks into the prompt #}
extras = {'openai_token': None, 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-1106', 'processor': 'aidict', 'iterate_field': "query"}

{# Process the input string: #}
# complete dict task by following step by step
1. The user has provided the following query:
"""
{{query[outer_index]}}
"""
2. A search was run against this query and the following document chunks were returned:
"""
{% for chunk in chunks %}
  {{ chunk }}
{% endfor %}
"""
3. The required key for the dictionary is: 'prompt'
4. The required value for the 'prompt' is a string.
5. Create a concise prompt for dall-e based on the user query from step 1. and use the information in step 3 and 4 to return a python dictionary:
